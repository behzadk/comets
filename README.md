# Computation of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space 
COMETS is a software platform for performing computer simulations of spatially structured microbial communities. It is based on stoichiometric modeling of the genome-scale metabolic network of individual microbial species using dynamic flux balance analysis, and on a discrete approximation of diffusion. COMETS is built and maintained by the [Daniel Segre Lab](www.bu.edu/segrelab) at Boston University.

COMETS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

# Documentation
Documentation on how to install and use COMETS is found at [comets-manual.readthedocs.io](https://comets-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Installation
COMETS can be downloaded from [www.bu.edu/segrelab/comets/](http://www.bu.edu/segrelab/comets/)

# Toolboxes
We have developed both a Matlab and a python toolbox to interface the Comets software. How to use these toolboxes are described in the [documentation](https://comets-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 - Matlab toolbox: [github.com/segrelab/comets-toolbox](https://github.com/segrelab/comets-toolbox)
 - Python toolbox: [github.com/djbajic/COMETS-Python-Toolbox](https://github.com/djbajic/COMETS-Python-Toolbox)
